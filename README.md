# Ros-Assignment level 2 (Pieter-URDF)

to use this URDF package the Scout Greenhouse project group made for their AGV you execute the following comments to use it:

```
cd catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/SvenAarts/pieter.git
cd ..
catkin_make
roslaunch pieter display.launch
``` 
In this package you also find the 'ros_assignment_level2_ Scout_greenhouse.mp4' in which you can see that the launch file works and the tf's of all the components are in the correct place.
It is filmed with a capture programm in ubuntu but we cant open it with the normal windows viewer. When you use VLC player it works just fine.
